# PRC API MOD - Discord Bot Maker
This is a mod I made for Discord Bot Maker, it assists beginers with connecting to the Police Roleplay Community API (ER:LC Roblox Game).

To use the mod, just add it to the "actions" folder and it should popup on your Discord Bot Maker ad "Use the PRC API" under the "JSON Things" folder.

Changing the "PRC API URL" area also changed the "Path" options.
I reccomend having Debug Mode enabled so stuff is logged in the Bot Log and you know what the errors are.

**Report any errors in a ticket in https://jestersoftware.xyz/discord and I'll get right back to you.**
You can delete this file and the license after you download and extract the files.
